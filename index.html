      <div class="content" style="text-align:justify"><P>Whereas we regard as part of the body of Christ the Church of Pentecost U.S.A.,
Inc.(herein after called “The Church”) that traces its origin to the Ministry   that
Rev. James McKeown began in Ghana  in 1937 and culminated  in the establishment of the Gold Coast Apostolic   Church  on the 21
st day of May,  1953,  thereafter renamed  the Church of Pentecost   on the 1st of August, 1962, and registered on the
14th day of June 1971 as a religious  non-profit making organization in Ghana, formerly
known as the Gold Coast;
<P>
And whereas the primary aims and objectives of the Church are to practice and
propagate what our Lord Jesus Christ commanded in the Bible, in the book of
Mark 16:15-16 “Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature,
he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved…” and in Matthew 25:40 “Inasmuch
as you have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done
it unto Me”;</P><P>
And whereas in 1987 the Church was established in New York City and registered
with the State of New York on January 29, 1989;</P>

<P>Accordingly, we set forth this Constitution to preserve and enhance the advancement
of the principles of our Christian faith, and to ensure that the Church will be
governed in an orderly manner, consistent with the accepted tenets of the Church.
The Church is also empowered to affiliate with churches and organizations with
similar doctrines, aims and objectives and to use all net receipts for religious, charitable,
educational and other related purposes.</P></div>

<div class="title" style="color:#ff3399">MISSION STATEMENT</div>
<div class="content" style="text-align:justify">The Church exists to bring all people everywhere to the saving knowledge of our
Lord Jesus Christ through the proclamation of the gospel, the planting of churches
and the equipping of believers for every God-glorifying service. It demonstrates
the love of God through the provision of social services in partnership with governments,
communities and other like-minded organizations.</div>

<div class="title" style="color:#ff3399">NOTE</div>

<p>1.1 THE BIBLE:</p><p>
We believe in the divine inspiration and authority of the Holy Bible. We believe
that the Bible is infallible in its declaration, final in its authority, all sufficient in its
provisions and comprehensive in its sufficiency (2 Timothy 3: 16; 2 Peter 1: 21).
</p><p>1.2 ONE (1) TRUE GOD:</p><p>
We believe in the existence of the One True God, Elohim, Maker of the whole universe;
indefinable, but revealed as Triune God–Father, Son and Holy Spirit- One in
nature, essence, and attributes; Omniscient, Omnipotent and Omnipresent (Genesis
1: 1; Matthew 3: 16-17; 28:19; 2 Corinthians 13: 14).
</p><p>1.3 MAN’S DEPRAVED NATURE:</p><p>
We believe that “all men have sinned and come short of the glory of God” and are
subject to eternal punishment; and need repentance and regeneration (Genesis 3:119;
Isaiah 53:6).
</p><p>1.4 THE SAVIOR:</p><p>
We believe that man needs a Savior. This need has been met in the person of Jesus
Christ for the following reasons: His deity, virgin birth, sinless life, atoning death,
resurrection, and ascension; also His abiding intercession and second coming to
judge the living and the dead (Matthew 1: 21; John 4:42; Ephesians 5: 23; Philippians
2: 6-11).

</p><p>1.5 REPENTANCE, REGENERATION, JUSTIFICATION AND
SANCTIFICATION:</p><p>
We believe all men have to repent of, confess their sins before God, and believe in
the vicarious death of Jesus Christ to be justified before God. We believe in the
sanctification of the believer through the working of the Holy Spirit and in God’s
gift of Eternal Life to the believer (Luke 15: 7; Acts 2: 38; Romans 4: 25; 5: 16; 1
Corinthians 1: 30; 1 Thessalonians 4: 3).
</p><p>1.6 THE ORDINANCES (SACRAMENTS) OF THE CHURCH:</p><p>
We believe in the following two (2) ordinances for the Church, baptism by immersion,
and Holy Communion – The Lord’s Supper. These are commanded by Jesus
Christ for His church (Matthew 28:19-20; Mark 16: 16; Luke 22: 19-20).
</p><p>1.7 BAPTISM, GIFTS AND FRUIT OF THE HOLY SPIRIT:</p><p>
We believe that baptism in the Holy Spirit with speaking in tongues as initial evidence
is for believers. Likewise, we believe in the operation of the gifts of the
Holy Spirit and the bearing of fruits in the lives of believers (Mark 16: 17; Acts
2:4; 1 Corinthians 12: 8-11; Galatians 5: 22-23).
</p><p>1.8 DIVINE HEALING:</p><p>
We believe that God’s will to heal is revealed in Scriptures. However, we do not
oppose the application of medicine or medical technology by qualified medical
practitioners for healing purposes (2 Kings 20:7; Matthew 9: 12; Luke 10:34;
Colossians 4: 14).
</p><p>1.9 TITHES AND OFFERINGS:</p><p>
We believe in tithing and in giving of freewill offerings towards the cause of carrying
forward the Kingdom of God. We believe that God blesses a cheerful giver
(Genesis 14: 18-20; 28: 20-22; Malachi 3; 6-10; Matthew 23: 23; Acts 20: 35; 1
Corinthians 16: 1-3; 2 Corinthians 9: 1-9).
</p><p>1.10 THE SECOND COMING AND THE NEXT LIFE:</p><p>
We believe in the Second Coming of Christ and the Resurrection of the dead, both
saved and unsaved; they that are saved, to the resurrection of life, and they that are
unsaved, to the resurrection of damnation (Mark 13: 26; Daniel 12: 2; John 5: 2829;
Acts 1: 11; 10: 42; Romans 2: 7-11; 6: 23).
